# MLB Lineups

A command-line tool for displaying MLB game lineups, starting pitchers, and umpire information.

## Features

- Display lineups for any MLB team
- Show batting order with player positions and jersey numbers
- View starting pitchers with jersey numbers and throwing arm (left/right)
- See game venue and umpire information
- Specify a date to look up past or future games
- No scores shown, so no risk of spoilers when watching time-shifted

## Why I Wrote This
I enjoy scoring baseball games that I watch on TV, which means I need starting lineups. This script provides convenient access to all the information that needs to go onto a scorecard.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - requests
  - pytz
  - pytest (for test suite)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlb-lineups.git
   cd mlb-lineups
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with:

```
python print_lineups.py [options]
```

### Command-line Options

- `--team TEAM`: Team abbreviation (default: NYM)
  - Examples: NYM, STL, LAD, NYY, CHC, etc.
  - All 30 MLB teams are supported

- `--date DATE`: Game date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - If not specified, defaults to today's date

### Examples

Display today's Mets lineup:
```
python print_lineups.py
```

Display today's Cardinals lineup:
```
python print_lineups.py --team STL
```

Display the Dodgers lineup for a specific date:
```
python print_lineups.py --team LAD --date 2025-04-15
```

## Output

The program displays:
- Teams playing, with venue
- Selected team's lineup with jersey numbers and positions
- Opponent lineup with jersey numbers and positions
- Starting pitchers for both teams, with jersey numbers and throwing arm
- Umpire crew with positions

Example output:
